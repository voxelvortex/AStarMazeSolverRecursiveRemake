# AStarMazeSolver Recursive Remake
A Maze solver I made using the A Star algorithm using recursion. I previously made a version of this that didn't use recursion, that was a while ago, and I think I can do it better.

## A Star Algorithm
The A Star Algorithm is based on the Dijkstra Algorithm, you can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@nicholas.w.swift/easy-a-star-pathfinding-7e6689c7f7b2) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)!

## Why I Decided To Make This
I saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-YPj5Vt0oQ) by a [Youtuber named Devon Crawford](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA) on a pathfinding program he made. I decided that I wanted to use the same algorithm he did to solve mazes... Then I learned recursion, and redid it, which is why we're both here.
